... Question: how long was the conversation?
... """
According to the provided CDR (Call Detail Record) data, the duration of the Follow Me call is 80 seconds.

>>> who was the calller?
According to the CDR data, the caller's number is 22202.

>>> in what countr call originated?
The original Called Party Number (OPN) is 22285, which starts with "222", indicating that it might be a country code for the United States or a similar 
region. However, without more specific information about the globalCallID_callId (861), it's difficult to determine the exact country of origin.

But based on the provided number 22202 and 22285 being the Enterprise number, it seems likely that the call originated from Mexico as the 222 prefix is 
commonly used in Mexico.

>>> +41 323 34 33 - from what country is this number?
The phone number +41 323 34 33 appears to be a Swiss phone number, given the country code "41", which corresponds to Switzerland.

>>> create me a svg graph where 3 participants communcate togehter. a call b and b get a email from c.
Here is an SVG graph representing the communication scenario:
```svg
<svg width="500" height="300">
  <style>
    . participant {
      fill: #ccc;
      stroke: #999;
      shape-radius: 50;
    }

    . call {
      fill: #007bff;
      stroke: #000;
      stroke-width: 2;
    }

    . email {

      stroke-width: 1;
    }
  </style>

  <!-- Participants -->

  <circle cx="200" cy="150" r="30" class="participant B" id="B"></circle>
  <circle cx="300" cy="250" r="30" class="participant C" id="C"></circle>

  <!-- Call between A and B -->
  <path d="M 100,50 L 200,150" class="call call-AB"></path>
  <text x="170" y="120" font-size="12">A → B</text>

  <!-- Email from C to B -->
  <path d="M 200,150 L 300,250" class="email"></path>
  <text x="250" y="220" font-size="10">C → B (Email)</text>
</svg>
```
This SVG graph represents the three participants: A, B, and C. The call between A and B is represented by a blue line connecting their positions, while 
the email from C to B is represented by a dashed green line.

You can customize this SVG code as per your requirements, adding more details such as call duration, timestamp, or any other information you'd like to include.

Please note that this is a simple representation and might not be suitable for production use. For a more complex communication scenario, consider using a dedicated graphing library or framework.
